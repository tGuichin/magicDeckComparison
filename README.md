# magicDeckComparison
small project to compare two Magic the Gathering decks

magicDeckComparison
Simple deck comparison for Magic The Gathering card game

How it works:

The user is given two buttons, with each opening a deck. Once the decks are opened they will show in the respective TextArea fields, and a successive check on the differences between both decks and shows those differences in the inner TextAreas. These decks are temporarily stored in a HashMap and are erased once a new Deck is opened or the user selects File > New.

In the differences fields, the 'M' stands for 'Missing cards from other deck', 'S' stands for a card from the 'Sideboard', a negative number means that the deck has the same card but a smaller count, and a positive means it has the same card but a higher count.
